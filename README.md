# SWE432 Restaurant-Review-Form Assignment

Initially I was required to clone my TA's swe432tomcat repository to get a scheleton for the web app.  My job in this project was to
implement the code necessary to make the web application display a form that allows a user to submit a review of a restaurant.  The 
final goal of this simple web application was to allow the server to capture the data from the review submitted by the user/browser 
and then persist it in the database that resides in Heroku (which is the cloud platform that I used to host the server and the database).
In order to prove that the data has been successfully persisted, after every user's submission, the server posts a table with the data
back to the user a table that displays all the current data from the database (including the review form submitted by the current user).  

As an extra feature, this web application displays the average rating of every restaurant that has gotten a review up to that point
in time.

If you want to take a look of at this application in action, this is the link:

Objectives of the project:
  To put into practice my knowledge of how to integrate the difrerent parts that comform a web application, which for this particular 
  application are as follow:
  
               HTML
               CSS
               Javascript
               Servlet Java
               Cloud Platform for Deployment
               Database Manipulation (JDBC)
               Maven Wrappers
               
  (Even though JSP's and are considered outdated technologies for the new generation of web applications, it was very useful to learn
  about them in order to comprehend the way in which all of the basic elements of web applications are interconnected and deployed).
